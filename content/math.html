        <h2>How does <abbr>HUSL</abbr> work?</h2>
        <p><abbr>HUSL</abbr> is defined as a conversion to and from <abbr>CIE&nbsp;LCh<sub>uv</sub></abbr>.
            For both <abbr>HUSL</abbr> and <abbr>HUSLp</abbr>, the first step
            is to find the chroma bounds for a given lightness. These are lines, crossing which will push the color
            out of the <abbr>RGB</abbr> gamut. We define a function, <em>getBounds(L)</em> which
            returns 6 straight lines in slope-intercept format. Each of them represents one of three
            <abbr>RGB</abbr> channels being pushed either below 0 or above 1.</p>
        <p><strong>HUSL:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Given a hue (angle), build a ray starting from <em>(0, 0)</em> and find the point where it first
                intersects with one of the bounding lines.
            </li>
            <li>The distance from <em>(0, 0)</em> to this point is the maximum chroma for given <em>L</em> and
                <em>H</em>. Scale saturation to be a percentage of this distance.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>HUSLp:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use perpendiculars to find the shortest distance from <em>(0, 0)</em> to one of the bounding lines.
            </li>
            <li>This distance is the lowest common chroma. For the given <em>L</em> and any <em>H</em> let
                saturation span this distance.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>I used <a href="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/">Maxima</a> to build and solve these equations, and <a
                href="https://github.com/husl-colors/husl/blob/master/math/bounds.wxm">a wxMaxima file</a> is
            bundled with the code explaining how to get the bounding lines. The rest is simple geometry you can see
            in the reference implementation.</p>
